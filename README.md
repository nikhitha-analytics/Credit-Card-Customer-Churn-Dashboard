Business Problem:

The bank is experiencing high customer attrition in its credit card segment. With only 16% churned customers in the dataset, identifying at-risk customers is challenging. If churn drivers are not understood, the bank risks losing high-value clients and revenue

Key questains such as:

   • What is the overall churn rate among credit card customers?

   • Which customer demographics (age, gender) are most likely to churn?

   • How does churn vary across different card categories (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum)?

   • What is the relationship between credit limit and customer churn?

   • Does tenure (months on book) influence churn rates?
   

  
• Goal of the Dashboard:

   To analyze churn patterns across customer demographics, credit limits, and card categories, and provide actionable insights that help the bank predict and reduce attrition.
